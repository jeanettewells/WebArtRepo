                        My name is Jeanette Margaret Wells and I attend the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. I aim to explore the dualities of both physical and emotional planes in the broader context of the intersections of art and technology. <br><br>

I am experienced in visual communication, branding, typography, concept development, drawing, intermediate coding, and collaboration, among many other disciplines. As a dedicated and open-minded team member, I would be a strong addition to any collaborative environment. <br><br>

My body of conceptual work is the reconstruction of aftermath. It incorporates clean, architectural, design-based elements to investigate the origin of experience through a secondary source. Using design as a tool for detachment, my work speaks primarily about human experience and what results from it. <br><br>

My work focuses largely on the illness of my deceased father, something that originated physically but has created a series of incorporeal effects. By creating ephemera drawn from my experiences, I recreate a feeling or emotion as a tangible thing, rather than represent the origin of that sensation. I aim to create a sense of removal from my own emotions by using the memory of a computer to parallel how my own memories exist. I create in various media, but most of my work results from the outcome of a combination of several types of practices. However, the majority of my work has originated in a digital realm that has, in some way or another, become physical. In this, I take the elusiveness of emotions and memories and make them material.
