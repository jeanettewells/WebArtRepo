    <!-- what is it? -->

    <p>Lungs is a memorial to the 4,500 slave labourers that worked in Hall A of the former Deutschen Waffen und Munitionsfabriken A.G. during the Second World War (now the main exhibition hall of ZKM). By computing the vital lung capacity of these forced workers, the program emits their last breath of air. 
            The project is based on ways of bridging the gap between the perception of data and social experience. The aim is to take computer records of local events or communities that have been reduced or demeaned to the status of information and to allow the people to re-experience and/or recover their own value.

    <!-- description -->

    <p> The term “Lungs” refers to the technique of giving a database a pair of lungs by calculating the human lung capacity that is represented by the individuals in that dataset and “breathing out” the result through an audio system.
        Using Nazi-created databases, YoHa wrote software that would display the data associated with each worker, calculate their estimated lung capacity, then emitting a sound that would displace an equivalent volume of air onto the face of a seated viewer in the gallery. </p>
        <p>Lungs emerged, in part, from YoHa’s interest in creating a work drawing on the history of American inventor Herman Hollerith’s electromechanical punch card machines, which tabulated and summarized vast quantities of information.</p>

    <!-- why is the internet necessary for this work? -->

    <p>This body of work is often described as software art, which focuses in particular on code as material, rather than the network, but they are included in net art classifcations because of YoHa’s keen analysis of code’s role in organizing networks and data-gathering systems.</p>

    <p>YoHa used computer records that had seemingly been reduced to data or dry statistical information to produce a more human experience and understanding of a social atrocity and its basis in data processing.</p>
