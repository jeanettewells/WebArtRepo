    <!-- what is it? -->

    <p>Image Objects are a series of works that exist somewhere between physical sculptures and altered documentation images. Each piece begins as a digital file, of which countless variations already exist. These are then rendered as UV prints on dibond and precision-cut to the form of the piece to create photographic prints with the depth and presence of a sculpture.
            Each time the pieces are documented officially (i.e., by the artist or by a gallery), the documentation photos are altered to create a new form which does not accurately represent the physical object, and generate new derivative works that build upon the initial objects. The viewer's experience becomes split between the physical encounter in a gallery setting and the countless variations of the objects circulated in prints, publications, and on the Internet. The documentation becomes a separate work in itself, incorporating elements of collage, techniques commonly used in professional image retouching, aestheticized digital watermarks, and more.

    <!-- description -->

    <p>Each work in the Image Objects series originates as a digital file, which is then printed on aluminum composite panels and precision cut so that they appear three-dimensional.<p/>

    <p>When the objects are photographed officially, Vierkant alters the documentation in order to create a new variation which differs noticeably from the object in the gallery through distortions and the addition of other imagery. Thus, the official documentation images have the status of original, distinct artworks.</p>

    <p>Vierkant’s series emerged in response to changing conditions for contemporary art viewership, with the rise of blogs like VVORK (founded 2007) and Contemporary Art Daily (2008) that reached widespread online audiences, and the adoption of smartphones and social media.</p>

    <!-- why is the internet necessary for this work? -->

    <p>Verkant's work highlighted the increasingly fluid boundaries between the physical object and the mediated digital image. The sculptures responded to a moment in which contemporary art audiences began to experience exhibitions primarily through its online representation. On a whole, Image Objects, the sculptures, images, and writing, shaped the emerging discussion around postinternet art. </p>
